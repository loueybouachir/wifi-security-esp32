## üéØ Features

- Scans and lists nearby WiFi access points
- Detects:
  - Open networks (no encryption)
  - Weak security protocols (WEP, WPA)
  - Hidden SSIDs (broadcast disabled)
  - Use of unauthorized channels (>11)
  - Evil Twin access points (duplicate SSID, different BSSID)
  - Deauthentication attacks
  - Appearance and disappearance of networks
  - Changes in security or RSSI
- Stores results in SPIFFS
- CLI-based display or HTML rendering via embedded web server
- Sends real-time **WhatsApp notifications**
- LCD display for visual feedback (via I2C module)
- LED (Green/Red) and Buzzer alerts for risky networks

## üöÄ How to Build and Flash

```bash
# Navigate to this subfolder
cd wifi-analyzer

# Set the ESP32 target
idf.py set-target esp32

# Optional: Configure scan interval or thresholds
idf.py menuconfig

# Build the firmware
idf.py build

# Flash the firmware to the ESP32 (replace COMx with your actual port)
idf.py -p COMx flash
`````
## üìå Notes
‚óè Final results are stored in /spiffs/comparative_report.csv and can be downloaded via the embedded web interface.

‚óè Network comparison (to detect changes) is done every N cycles (configurable).

‚óè Notifications are sent only when a critical threat is detected.

‚óè Before compiling  set your local network SSID and PASSWORD in /main/app_status.c to ensure ESP32 WiFi connectivity.

‚óè To enable WhatsApp alerts, set your PHONE_NUMBER, API_KEY, BOT_TOKEN, and CHAT_ID (CallMeBot API)

‚óè If you want to switch to Telegram Bot visit /main/telegram_sender.c

‚óè To visualize the final results in the web interface:
Open a browser connected to the same WiFi network as the ESP32 and visit:
http://<your-esp32-ip>/results
